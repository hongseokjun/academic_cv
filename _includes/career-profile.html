    <p align="justfy">I am a neuroimager having interests in typical and atypical brain development. My research has focused on advanced multimodal imaging in malformations of cortical development, and now I seek to broaden my scope to other  disorders such as Autism and ADHD. Applying a rich array of structural and functional MRI and connectome markers, I aim at a comprehensive understanding of large-scale pathogeneic mechanisms related to neurodevelopment, together with an association of these imaging features to underlying genetic substrates. My full CV is <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

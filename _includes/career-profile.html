    <p align="justfy">I am a neuroimager having interests in typical and atypical brain development. My research has focused on advanced multimodal imaging in malformations of cortical development, and now I seek to broaden my scope to other  disorders such as Autism and ADHD. Applying a rich array of structural and functional MRI and connectome markers, I aim at a comprehensive understanding of large-scale pathogeneic mechanisms related to neurodevelopment, together with an association between imaging and underlying genetic data. </p>
